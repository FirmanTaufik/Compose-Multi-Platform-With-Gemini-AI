# Compose-Multiplatform-With-Gemini-AI #

I just exploring Compose Multiplatform and Gemini API, this is simple App can make request to Gemini help us every question and i just add feature upload image to make request also to Gemini recognize the image. 😃😃

# Helper #
- Thanks to my time to learn this.
- I also super thanks to Google Developer I/O Extended who has make event and Workshop Compose Multiplatform talking Gemini AI.
- Well i really appreciated with this https://github.com/isfaaghyth/gemini-ai-kmp thanks for sharing Mr.isfaaghyth.

# What I Use In This App #
- Core of this Gemini API (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-overview#curl_1)
- Depedency Injection with Koin refer (https://insert-koin.io/)
- Ktor as HTTP Request (https://ktor.io/)
- peekaboo as image picker, this library is amazing btw (https://github.com/onseok/peekaboo)

# Note #
I really sorry for anyone ask me why not use SDK, while i init this project unfortunately Google not yet provide for Compose Multiplatfrom or KMP.  So we go for API for exploring for other options.

Well if you want to clone or make this app more powerfull go ahead just create Gemini API key and paste in composeApp\src\commonMain\kotlin\di\network\GeminiApi.kt you can  paste
the key in variable name KEY..😊😊😊
