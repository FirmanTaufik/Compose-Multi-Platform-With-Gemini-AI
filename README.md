- I also super thanks to Google Developer I/O Extended who has make event and Workshop Compose Multiplatform talking Gemini AI.
- Well i really appreciated with this https://github.com/isfaaghyth/gemini-ai-kmp thanks for sharing Mr.isfaaghyth.

# What We I Use In This App #
- Core of this Gemini API (https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-overview#curl_1)
- Depedency Injection with Koin refer (https://insert-koin.io/)
- Ktor as HTTP Request (https://ktor.io/)

# Note #
I really sorry for anyone ask me why not use SDK, while i init this project unfortunately Google not yet provide for Compose Multiplatfrom or KMP.  So i go for API for exploring for other options.
